Software support package for SCALE-MS Workshop on Adaptive Ensembles
====================================================================

The ``scalems_workshop`` package is distributed with the workshop materials
hosted at https://github.com/SCALE-MS/workshop

The workshop software relies heavily on wrappers for the ``gmxapi`` package,
which requires a compatible installation of GROMACS.
